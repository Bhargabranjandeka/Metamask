# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For this assignment I have made use of the Window object from the browser environment to get the states of Eth from Metamask.

Pros- This eliminates the compatibilty issues of the legacy browsers.
Cons - lack the use of web3 Lib functions and hooks.
